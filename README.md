# KADAIF

An anomaly detection method specifically designed for microbiome data. 

This Github repository contains three folder:
1. **src** - Contains the implementation of KADAIF (MicrobiomeIsolationForest.py and KADAIF.py), an implementation of [CLOUD (published by Montassier et al.)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-018-0514-4), and scripts for contamination and mislabeling tests as described in the manuscript.
2. **run_on_datasets** - Bash and Python scripts for running and reproducing the specific mislabeling and contamination tests outlined in the manuscript. Due to GitHub file size limitations, raw data and results are not included.
3. **analysis** - Jupyter notebooks with the analysis results from the manuscript.

For a detailed guide on running KADAIF and an example, see here:
